To compile this backend as part of SyncEvolution, ensure that this directory
is visible at src/backends/activesync (symlink or copy), run ./autogen.sh at
the top level, and use --enable-activesync in configure. To work around the
missing libeassync.pc, on MeeGo install activesyncd-devel and use:
ACTIVESYNC_CFLAGS="-I<path to sources>/libeassync/src/ -I/usr/include/libwbxml-1.0 -I/usr/include/libxml2/ -I/usr/include/evolution-data-server-2.32" ACTIVESYNC_LIBS=-leassync

Beware that the pre-compiled activesyncd must match the header files from
the sources.

To compile as part of the activesync repo, please add a configure
script which uses syncevolution.pc to find include files and libs. The
Makefile.am here might already work. Set ENABLE_ACTIVESYNC in your config.h.

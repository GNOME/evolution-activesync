#-------------------------------------------------

# This project file is not used in production builds; it is
# here to make it easy to use QtCreator in development. Please
# ensure that any changes here are also reflected (and tested)
# in Makefile.am.

# The Makefile in this directory can be generated either from
# Makefile.am (the normal method, achieved by running 'configure'
# in the parent directory), or by running 'qmake' in this directory
# to generate it from this .pro file.

# Prevent the 'signals' and 'slots' pseudo-keywords from being defined (as they clash
# with variable names in the C code). Now have to use Q_SLOTS and Q_SIGNALS instead.

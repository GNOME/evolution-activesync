/*
Outstanding issues:
How do drafts work (AS docs say email can't be added to server using sync command with add)?
How does AS expose 'answered' / 'forwarded'? investigate email2:ConversationIndex (timestamps are added when email replied to/forwarded but not clear how to distinguish between those two things?
*/

/*
API Questions / todos:

// TODO define an 'email config' API (for, eg, window_size, filtertype etc rather than passing those options over DBus with each sync...)
